                                    Yesterday, my university asked us to prepare this topic for group discussion. I scratched my head for hour trying to decide what to speak on it. First I have to decide on what side should I speak, then what are the key points which I have to cover. So, I go with internet and read dozens of article. And got some fascinated facts and points. So, There is one very old conundrum:
                                </p>
                                <h2 class="bitquote">"Who Comes First, a Chicken or an Egg."</h2>
                                <p class="bitdo">This is same for businessman, "who come first, An Employee or a Customer". Most of the savvy leaders are confused with this question. Many books are written on this and many more to come. The whole brand and work of the company is depend on the employee. "The creative is your employee, the creative is your company", and it really make sense. Customer is also an important entity for any business.
                                    <br>
                                    <br>Customers, this is really a big great class of people which must be satisfied with the product or service the company is providing. Company like Nestle. In India, there was thousands of Maggi packets was purchased before the Lead testing of it but now not even a one. People in India are not as afraid of eating tobacco as afraid of eating Maggi. And one must has to focus on customers because after all customers are the final goal as Sam Walton says:</p>
                                <h2 class="bitquote">"The goal as a company is to have customer service that is not just the best, but legendary."<br><br>"Rule 1: The customer is always right. Rule 2: If the customer is ever wrong, re-read Rule 1."<br>-Stew Leonard</h2>
                                <p class="bitdo">
                                    So, there are two road for every company. Right or Wrong, If one doing right and products are really great then the customer will always be happy. Then one has to focus on employees. There's very old simple notion, "If you take care of your people then they take care of your customers and if you don't then they don't". That is just plain old common sense. This world is constantly improving and becoming more competitive. And if you are not taking care of your employee and If they are talented then they pick themselves up and move to another playground. No longer is your company is a ship in the sea. If customers are not satisfied with the product and employee are on your side then with them one can create another product and make it more creative and good.
                                    <br>
                                    <br>Some leaders say that, they are in the market for customer, so they will prefer customers over employee and give their fullest to customers and never focus on employees. This result in, employee's dissatisfaction with the company and then they are not able to give their best to the customers. And this really happens.
                                    <br>
                                    <br>Without egg there is no chicken and without chicken there is no egg, I don't know about you but I love both. And most of the greatest companies which are at the top of the charts are following this strategy. They give importance to both.
                                </p>
                                <h2 class="bitquote">"Employees who believe that management is concerned about them as a whole person - not just an employee - are more productive, more satisfied, more fulfilled. Satisfied employees mean satisfied customers, which leads to profitability."<br>-Anne M. Mulchay</h2>
